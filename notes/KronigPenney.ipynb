    "# Introduction to Bandstructure: Kronig-Penney model of a solid\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a brief demonstration of what is possible in the notebook using a real model in physics. It is not intended to teach the details of the Kronig Penny model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to bear in mind with this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The notebook is an interactive document. Code is executable.\n",
    "* The notebook is running in a web-browser so the compute kernel could be running anywhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * If you had installed [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on your personal machine, for example, the compute kernel might be running there. No internet connection required -- everything would be local -- just like MATLAB or Mathematica.\n",
    "    * You might be using the [experimental JupytyerHub innstallation on Iceberg](http://rcg.group.shef.ac.uk/iceberg/using-iceberg/accessing/jupyterhub.html) in which case the compute kernel would be running on a worker node of Sheffield's HPC system.\n",
    "    * You might be running the notebook in [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/) in which case the compute kernel would be running on Google's cloud infrastructre.\n",
    "* The notebook is fully editable - The text, the code, everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook allows for several teaching styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could refer the student to the theory in Kittel http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000803.html\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kittel](http://media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage300/03/EHEP0008/EHEP000803.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could put the full theory here in the notebook. Equations are typeset using a varient of LateX. For example, here is the equation we need to solve to get the band structure of the Kronig-Penney model\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\beta^2-\\alpha^2}{2\\alpha\\beta} \\sinh(\\beta b) \\sin(\\alpha a) - \\cosh(\\beta b)\\cos(\\alpha a) = \\cos(a+b)k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could include a video of a lecture..either locally or on YouTube. Here is a Kronig-Penney video I found on YouTube:\n",
